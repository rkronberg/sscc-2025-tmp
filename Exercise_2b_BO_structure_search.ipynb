    "This tutorial demonstrates how to use BO to optimize the atomistic configuration of materials. This can be done by mapping the configurational degrees of freedom to the total energy landscape, and inferring the global minimum of energy. The energy landscapes, refined by iterative data acquisitons, can be employed to visualise low energy configurations (they are chemically interpretable).\n",

    "At the outset, the user should consider which **key degrees of freedom** control the energetics of the research problem. In the case of adsorption of organic molecules to the surface, these could be the molecule position or orientation above the surface. The molecular conformation can often be kept fixed. In the case of flexible molecules, we need to conduct a conformer search and minimize the energy with respect to dihedral angles. The degrees of freedom and their bounds define the N-dimensional BO structure search.\n",

Flexible use of external functions is facilitated by the BOSS **user function**, where the user transforms the BO sampling across the defined search domain into an atomistic configuration, the calculation is performed, and the desired value is parsed and returned.\n",
